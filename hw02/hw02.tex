\prob{1} Suppose that $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is an equivalence of
small categories.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Show that, for all objects $x, y \in \Ob \mathcal{C}$, $F$ provides a
    bijection
    \[
      \Hom_\mathcal{C}(x, y) \to \Hom_\mathcal{D}(F(x), F(y)),
    \]
    so that $\End_\mathcal{C}(x) \cong \End_\mathcal{D}(F(x))$ as monoids.

    \begin{proof}
      By hypothesis, $F$ provides a set-theoretic map
      \[
        \Hom_\mathcal{C}(x, y) \to \Hom_\mathcal{D}(F(x), F(y)).
      \]
      In particular, as $F$ is an equivalence, we have a functor $G :
      \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{C}$ which provides a map
      \[
        \Hom_\mathcal{D}(F(x), F(y)) \to \Hom_\mathcal{C}(GF(x), GF(y)).
      \]
      That $F$ and $G$ are components of an equivalence also implies there are
      natural transformations $\mu : \Id_\mathcal{C} \to GF$ and $\eta :
      \Id_\mathcal{D} \to FG$ which are isomorphisms in the functor category
      $\Fun(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{D})$. In particular, this means $GF(x) \cong
      x$ for all $x \in \mathcal{C}$ and that $\Hom_\mathcal{C}(x, y) \cong
      \Hom_\mathcal{C}(GF(x), GF(y))$ (this is witnessed by $\mu$). Of course,
      we may say analogous things about objects in $\mathcal{D}$, the
      set-theoretic maps of $\Hom$-sets defined initially have two-sided
      inverses. This proves the original claim, and the only thing to verify is
      that these maps are compatible with the monoidal structure of
      $\End_\mathcal{C}(x)$ (but, of course, this follows from the compatibility
      conditions on the functor $F$ for $\mathcal{C}$-associativity).
    \end{proof}

  \item Show that $x \cong y$ in $\mathcal{C}$ if and only if $F(x) \cong F(y)$
    in $\mathcal{D}$.

    \begin{proof}
      If $x \xrightarrow{\phi} y$ is an isomorphism in $\mathcal{C}$, then
      $F(\phi)$ is an isomorphism in $\mathcal{D}$ (this is true for any
      functor). For the other direction, we consider an isomorphism $F(x)
      \xrightarrow{\theta} F(y)$ in $\mathcal{D}$. Using the same naming
      conventions as the previous problem, we have that $GF(x) \cong GF(y)$,
      however (as previously noted), $GF(x) \cong x$ due to the existence of the
      natural isomorphism $\mu$.
    \end{proof}

  \item Let $\mathcal{E}$ be a further category. Show that the functor
    categories $\Fun(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{E})$ and $\Fun(\mathcal{D},
    \mathcal{E})$ are naturally equivalent.

    \begin{proof}
      Define a functor $A : \Fun(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{E}) \to \Fun(\mathcal{D},
      \mathcal{E})$ by sending a functor $H$ to $G \circ H$. This defines a
      functor of functor categories by the observation that the composition of
      functors is a functor (say this sentence ten times fast). Similarly,
      define a functor $B$ via precomposition with $F$. We lift the natural
      transformations $\mu$, $\eta$ to the functor categories via a similar
      process. In particular, given two functors $I, J \in \Fun(\mathcal{C},
      \mathcal{E})$ with a natural transformation $\nu : I \to J$, we consider a
      lift of $\eta$:
      \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
          I \ar[r, "\nu"] \ar[d, "\hat{\eta}"] & J \ar[d, "\hat{\eta}"] \\
          BA(I) \ar[r] & BA(J)
        \end{tikzcd}
      \]
      where we note that $BA(I) = F G I$, and $\eta$ provides a map from $FG \to
      \Id_\mathcal{C}$. In particular, repeating this process to lift $\mu$ to
      $\hat{\mu}$ gives a natural isomorphism $A \cong B$, which finishes the
      proof.
    \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}

\prob{2} Let $C$ be a category and let $x, y \in \Ob \mathcal{C}$. Prove that if
$x \cong y$ then $\Hom(x, -)$ and $\Hom(y, -)$ are naturally isomorphic
functors.

\begin{proof}
  We provide two ways to see this. The first is to recall that the Yoneda
  embedding of a category into its presheaf category is fully faithful (there is
  a slight problem here that the presheaf category consists of the contravariant
  functors $\mathcal{C} \to \Set$, but the proof carries through in the
  covariant case similarly).

  The second, and much more fun, answer, is to note that this question is simply
  a special case of the final part of problem $(1)$, where we let $\mathcal{C}$
  be the $2$-category of small categories, then $x \cong y$ is the statement
  that ``$x$ is equivalent to $y$'' as categories, and the $\Hom$-sets become
  $\Fun$-sets.
\end{proof}

\prob{3} Let $F, G : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ be functors and $\eta : F \to
G$ be natural transformations.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Show that if, for all $x \in \Ob \mathcal{C}$, the mapping $\eta_x :
    F(x) \to G(x)$ is an isomorphism in $\mathcal{D}$, then $\eta$ is a natural
    isomorphism.

    \begin{proof}
      The map $\eta_x$ has an inverse $\eta_x$. I claim that the collection of
      $\mu_x$ gives a natural transformation $\mu$ which inverts $\eta$. We
      see this by a careful examination of the following diagram:
      \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
          F(x) \ar[r] \ar[d, bend left, "\eta_x"] & F(y) \ar[d, bend left,
          "\eta_y"] \\
          G(x) \ar[r] \ar[u, bend left, "\mu_x"] & G(y) \ar[u, bend left,
          "\mu_y"]
        \end{tikzcd}
      \]
      That everything commutes follows from $\mu_x$ inverting $\eta_x$. In
      particular, we have a natural transformation, as we have provided a
      collection of necessary maps, and they satisfy the diagramatic criterion
      from requirement that $\mu_x$ is a (strict) inverse of $\eta_x$. That
      $\mu$ is a two sided inverse of $\eta$ is inherited from $\mu_x$ being a two
      sided inverse of $\eta_X$.
    \end{proof}

  \item Suppose that $F$ is an equivalence of categories and that $F$ is
    naturally isomorphic to $G$, so $F \simeq G$. Show that $G$ is an
    equivalence of categories.

    \begin{proof}
      
    \end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
